============
Want to play around with this to learn pushing, pulling and merging and keeping it all together? 

Here's what you do:
1. email me so I can add you to the repo
2. make a new Intellij or (God forbids) Eclipse project
3. run git init in the SRC(!) FOLDER. If you do it in the parent folder, it will mess things up
4. push and pull all you want, then we can learn how to cope with changes
